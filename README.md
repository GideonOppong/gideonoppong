# Hi, I'm Gideon Oppong👋 
### Cybersecurity Aspirant | AI App Developer | Tech Transitioner

---

## 🛡️ Professional Summary
I am a security-focused builder transitioning from teaching integrated science into Cybersecurity. 
By combining the **Google Cybersecurity Professional Certificate** with hands-on **AI App Development (Co.Lab)**, 
I bridge the gap between building functional tools and securing them against modern threats.


## 📂 Featured Repositories

### 🔸 **Security-Labs**
Hands-on cybersecurity labs covering incident response, network analysis, malware investigation, log analysis, and threat detection.

## 🚀 Featured Project: Secure AI Automation Ecosystem
**Tools:** Make.com, AppSheet, Google Sheets, Gmail API, OpenAI
* **The Build:** Developed an AI-driven automation suite to streamline [Email filtering app].
* **The Security Twist:** Audited the data pipeline for **OWASP Top 10** vulnerabilities; restricted API scopes to **Principle of Least Privilege**.
* **[Link to Project Folder or Case Study]**
### 🖥️ App Interface Overview

# 🛡️ Cybersecurity Analysis Labs
> **Objective:** A collection of hands-on technical labs completed during the Google Cybersecurity Professional Certificate, focusing on threat detection, incident response, and network security.

---

## 🔍 Lab 1: Network Traffic Analysis with Wireshark
**Scenario:** Identified a potential brute-force attack on a simulated internal server by analyzing packet captures.

### 🛠️ Tools & Skills
* **Tools:** Wireshark, TCPDump
* **Skills:** Packet Inspection, Protocol Analysis (TCP/UDP/HTTP), Identifying Suspicious IP Beacons.

### 📸 Documentation
![Wireshark Analysis Screenshot](link-to-your-screenshot-here)
*Caption: Filtering for failed login attempts (HTTP 401) to identify the source IP of the attacker.*

### 📝 Key Findings
* **The Vulnerability:** The server was accepting unencrypted HTTP traffic on Port 80.
* **The Mitigation:** Recommended transitioning to HTTPS (TLS 1.3) and implementing an Account Lockout Policy after 5 failed attempts.

---

## 🛡️ Lab 2: SQL Injection Defense & Database Security
**Scenario:** Performed a vulnerability assessment on a web application to identify SQLi entry points.

### 🛠️ Tools & Skills
* **Tools:** SQL, Linux Terminal
* **Skills:** Database Querying, Input Validation, Vulnerability Assessment.

### 📸 Documentation
![SQL Lab Screenshot](link-to-your-screenshot-here)
*Caption: Using specific SQL queries to audit user permissions and identify unauthorized data access.*

### 📝 Key Findings
* **The Vulnerability:** Lack of "Prepared Statements" allowed for raw SQL commands to be executed via the search bar.
* **The Mitigation:** Implemented input sanitization and the **Principle of Least Privilege** for the database user account.

---

## 🐍 Lab 3: Automating Security Tasks with Python
**Scenario:** Created a script to automate the parsing of server logs to identify "Flagged" IP addresses.

### 🛠️ Tools & Skills
* **Tools:** Python 3, Linux (Ubuntu)
* **Skills:** Scripting, Log Analysis, Automation.
# Simple script to check if an IP is in the 'Allow List'
def check_access(ip_address):
    import_list = ["192.168.1.1", "192.168.1.50"]
    if ip_address in import_list:
        print("Access Granted")
    else:
        print("Access Denied - Flagged for Review")
